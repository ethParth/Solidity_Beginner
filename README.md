# Token

This Solidity program is a simple "Token" program that demonstrates the basic mint and burn functionality of a token. The purpose of this program is to create a token named MyToken allows the minting and burning of that token, and maintaining the total supply of that token.
## Description

This project showcases the development of a custom token on the Ethereum blockchain, with minting and burning capabilities for managing the total token supply. It provides a practical example for those interested in understanding token creation and supply management within the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., Token.sol). Copy and paste the code from token.sol into the editor.

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.21" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile Token.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "Token" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the mint and burn functions. Click on the "Token" contract in the left-hand sidebar, and then click on the functions within. Finally, click on the "transact" button to execute the function.
